## Frequently Asked Questions

### What should I look for in lab test results?

Quality lab reports should show testing for heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic), microbials (salmonella, E. coli, yeast, mold), and alkaloid content. Look for recent testing dates, proper laboratory credentials, and batch numbers that match your product. Avoid vendors who refuse to provide lab reports or offer only generic, outdated results.

### How do I know if kratom is fresh?

Fresh kratom has a vibrant green color (for green strains), fine powder consistency, and strong, earthy aroma. Old or stale kratom appears dull, clumpy, or has little smell. Reputable vendors provide harvest dates and process kratom within weeks of harvesting. Proper storage in cool, dry conditions helps maintain freshness.

### What's the difference between kratom strains?

Kratom strains are categorized by vein color and origin region. Red veins typically offer relaxing effects, white veins provide energizing properties, and green veins deliver balanced effects. Regional names like Maeng Da, Bali, or Borneo indicate specific growing areas with unique alkaloid profiles. However, effects can vary between individuals and batches.

### How much should I expect to pay for quality kratom?

Quality kratom typically costs $80-150 per kilogram when buying in bulk, or $15-30 for smaller 100-250g quantities. Extremely cheap kratom often indicates poor quality, while premium vendors may charge more for small-batch, organic, or specially processed varieties. Factor in shipping costs and available discounts when comparing prices.

### Is it legal to buy kratom online?

Kratom legality varies by state and local jurisdiction. It's federally legal in the United States but banned in several states including Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Some cities and counties have local bans. Always verify current laws in your area before purchasing, as regulations can change frequently.

### How long does kratom stay fresh after opening?

Properly stored kratom maintains potency for 1-3 months after opening when kept in airtight containers away from light, heat, and moisture. Unopened packages can stay fresh for 6-12 months under proper storage conditions. Signs of degradation include color fading, clumping, musty odors, or reduced effectiveness.
